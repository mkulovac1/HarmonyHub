</a>

The Harmony hub application is a web application primarily used for listening to music. Through this application, you can also see which songs are currently the most popular or which singers are currently the most popular. You can choose a specific genre of music. You can also search for a specific song or singer through the search engine. For each singer, it is possible to see biography and the songs he/she owns. Also, you can see the lyrics for each song. You can choose to see only songs from your country, too.
